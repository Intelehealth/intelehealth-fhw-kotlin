Tanvir code review
1. Member variable must be declared with `private` access modifier if not used outside the class.
2. When we can pass the PrescriptionStatusCount as argument then why we have called the
function `getPrescriptionStatusCount` to show the received and pending count?
3. Can we not use same prescription fragment for both received and pending prescriptions?
