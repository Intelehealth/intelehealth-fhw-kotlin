Tanvir code review
1. Member variable must be declared with `private` access modifier if not used outside the class.
2. When we can pass the PrescriptionStatusCount as argument then why we have called the
function `getPrescriptionStatusCount` to show the received and pending count?
3. Can we not use same prescription fragment for both received and pending prescriptions?
4. view_filter.xml chip component should be used for filter chips instead of custom view.
5. Why we can not achieve different view types within single recycler view adapter?
6. Use ShapableImageView instead of CardView for profile picture.
