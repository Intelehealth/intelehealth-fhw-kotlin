# fhw-kotlin
The repository is meant to handle migration of Mobile code from Java to Kotlin

# Key Improvements
* Adopted a modular design approach to enhance scalability and maintainability.
* Improved Gradle build system using Kotlin DSL with well-structured dependencies.
* Shared BuildConfig across all modules for consistent configuration management.
* Refactored the local database structure to reduce boilerplate code and improve efficiency.
* Ensured separation of business logic from the UI layer to maintain clear boundaries.
* Bound UI components in layouts directly to data sources using DataBinding.
* Designed robust handling of various API states, including Loading, Success, Fail, Error, and Network Lost, with appropriate UI rendering.
* Implemented a single source of truth for data management to ensure consistency.
* Applied Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) principles for predictable and manageable state transitions.
* Achieved smooth data synchronization for pull/push API interactions.
* Enabled auto-reflection of UI changes upon modifications in the local database.
* Enhanced user experience by leveraging modern UI components and best practices.
* Refactored all classes and the UI layer using Kotlin and the latest Android components.
* Implemented custom screen navigation animations using the Navigation Graph.
* Organized resources categorically for better maintainability and readability.
* Integrated Dependency Injection with Dagger-Hilt for a clean and efficient codebase.
* Developed code following Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology for reliability.
* Conducted static code analysis and ensured code quality using tools like Detekt and GitHub Actions.
